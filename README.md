## Setup

We recommend doing so with R in a JupyterLab environment.

To install JupterLab, run:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

To run R code in JupyterLab you will need the `IRkernel` R package. Follow [these instructions](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) to set it up.

We have already created a `data` folder where you can store your raw data, and a `notebooks` folder where you can save your Jupyter notebooks. You will also find some example data and notebooks.

Clone this repository to your local machine, create your new notebooks and push them to the online repository to receive feedback from your teacher!
